## v0.27.0 · why a second surface {#why}

### One engine, three surfaces
- refers-to: src/ops.rs
- kind: decision
- logged: v0.27.0 · 2026-10-11

formai_dev's plan named `hub/cli/` as a second thin surface over the core (Phase 6). It exists now because agents need it: Claude Code, Codex and Cursor reach FormPortal through `./formportal mcp`. `ops.rs` calls `formportal-core` only; it never re-implements install, verify or rollback, so the window and the agents cannot behave differently.

### No service, no consent dialog
- refers-to: src/mcp.rs :: tools, INSTRUCTIONS
- kind: decision
- logged: v0.27.0 · 2026-10-11

FormEncoder's MCP goes through its running engine and asks the person in its window. FormPortal has no resident process (a stated promise), so the MCP server runs the core in its own process. Confirmation is the client's tool approval plus the instructions and annotations: `install` is marked as changing the computer, `rollback` and `remove` as destructive, and the server's instructions and the harness skill tell the agent to ask first. A window-side consent prompt would need the window running; it is a plan item, not a gap hidden here.

### stdout is the protocol
- refers-to: src/mcp.rs :: serve · ../formportal :: mcp
- kind: warning-context
- logged: v0.27.0 · 2026-10-11

Only JSON-RPC lines go to stdout. The dispatcher builds with `cargo build -q` to stderr, and install progress in the CLI goes to stderr. The `install` tool passes a no-op progress callback.

### The registry inside the binary
- refers-to: src/ops.rs :: REGISTRY, apps
- kind: decision
- logged: v0.27.0 · 2026-10-11

`catalog/products.json` is compiled in with `include_str!`, so `apps` names every Form app with its status even when the catalogue is unreachable or refused; the catalogue's error is returned beside it as `catalog_error` rather than failing the call.

### Local catalogues
- refers-to: src/ops.rs :: load
- kind: explainer
- logged: v0.27.0 · 2026-10-11

A `source` that is not an http(s) address is read as a file and parsed without a signature, like the core's install example; it is for fixtures and development. Remote sources go through `Portal::catalog`, signature and all, with `allow_unsigned` only when asked.

### Verified
- refers-to: src/mcp.rs
- kind: explainer
- logged: v0.27.0 · 2026-10-11

Driven through `./formportal mcp` against a two-release local catalogue served on 127.0.0.1:8899 with a scratch `FORMPORTAL_ROOT`: initialize, tools/list (eight), install 1.0.0, open (the installed script ran), install 1.1.0, rollback (current 1.0.0), installs, remove, an unknown tool (isError). From the CLI: a catalogue with a wrong SHA-256 was refused before unpacking, and an unsigned remote catalogue without `--allow-unsigned` was refused.
